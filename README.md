**What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

This class allowed me to better understand what developers do, and what types of hardware and software that is needed. I learned how to apply Cloud development concepts to include containerization, and serverless architecture with AWS. By understanding these concepts will allow me to better support the developers who I work with.

**Describe your strengths as a software developer.**

I am not a strong software developer, that is not what I am working towards. But, being able to better support those who do development work is crucial. Keeping up to date with available technologies and help my company enhance their marketability is imperative as my role as a project manager.

**Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.**

Upon completion of my degree, I will be assuming the role of a project manager. I am confident that after the courses I have taken and my hands on experience in the field will allow me to be a capable and confident project manager, with the ability to lead my team effectively.

**How would you handle scale and error handling?**

I would initiate the process of scaling the selected web application. This would be accomplished by first using the CloudWatch service to configure and then apply AWS auto scaling. The use of AWS auto scaling would allow the application the ability to allocate increasing resources dependent upon on the level of traffic and adjustments to the read capacity for the DynamoDB databases. The I would need to mitigate error handling; this would be accomplished throw the AWS functions and automation that would handle issues with the use of services such as Lambda.

**How would you predict the cost?**

The first thing to do would be to determine the cost using the AWS cost explorer. This would help to gauge the average cost for an application of similar size and the usage resources for my specific application. The cost explorer would also help to determine which plan would best fits within my budget and to determine associated costs from other AWS services.

**What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?**

While there are many benefits to serverless computing (most notably be cost savings, by paying only for resources that are used). I think that containers offer more predictable cost analysis, because the rate for managing containers is more consistent. But, if a company can handle the variations that occur every month, in regard to demand and resources activity, might be more inclined to use a serverless approach.

**Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.**

A deciding factor when planning for an expansion would involve the amount of interest in the web application. A second factor to consider would be the cost of migrating or transitioning the current application to a cloud/serverless approach. There could be long-term savings is cloud migration, but the up-front costs might be too high. The company should also take into account the level of security that is needed and determine if what is available will fit the needs of the company and the application it is creating.

**What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?**

Elasticity allows organizations to be better prepared, when anticipating future growth, because resources can be being increased or lowered in response to the demand. This is directly related to the pay-for-service model that AWS uses. AWS services have the capacity to automatically adjust to scale from the beginning. These types of payment options encourage companies to test their capacity on a regular basis to ensure that they retain a level of stability even if there is rapid growth.
